                    <p>Want a great job in tech? Want a six-figure salary? Then you have come to the right
                        place. I am going to tell you all you need to know to get all of that and much more,
                        without you lifting a finger. You can learn passively. Just sit back, close your eyes,
                        and let the sound of my voice make the code sink deep into your brain.
